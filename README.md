# 1. Overview
Welcome to the app "Reach!" Regarding how I came up with this idea, I would essentially frequent using workout tutorials that provide explanations and guides that I could rely on. In my fitness, I prefer to always have a resource ready rather than trying to keep switching between sources and getting lost. Many resources exist online to provide details and demonstrations for workouts since that's the real meat and potatoes of getting in shape but I know about the unsung hero. To make a lot of workouts possible requires proper care of your muscles and not just through food. Stretches and flexibility reduce tension and allow instant recovery for most muscles in pain and this is true whether in the gym or in the office. Most people shurg these things off so I wanted to streamline the process to at least encourage people to take care of their physical being some more.

As they go throughout the routine, users will be able cycle through which formation they need to utilize and click on a details page for each exercise to look at any in-depth explanations on how to perform it. There is a video accompanied by a text-based description to follow through for maximum efficiacy in tutorial demonstrations. Additionally, there is a Glossary page where if users want to refer and flip to whatever muscle they are interested about, they can read up on the information directly.
